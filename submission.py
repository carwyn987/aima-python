You are expected to take some time to explore the repository in order
to understand the syntax and structure of the provided codebase. This
is an excellent opportunity to practice reading and reasoning about
existing code — a skill that is crucial in research and industry alike,
where you'll often need to extend or modify large, mature projects.

The most relevant files to review before beginning this part are:
    • planning.py
    • tests/test_planning.py
    • tests/test_graphplan.py

# PART 1.1: Implement Actions & Domain Components
################################################################
"""
You must implement the necessary remaining three actions:
 - 'MoveLeft(c, frm, to)'
 - 'MoveUp(c, frm, to)'
 - 'MoveDown(c, frm, to)'
Be careful - this code is case sensitive.

Next, implement the 'AdjacentUp' and 'AdjacentDown' domain 
definitions. We have implemented 'AdjacentLeft' and
'AdjacentRight' programatically. You can define a similar
generator, or hardcode the relations manually.

At this point, the rush_hour_4x4 function should return a
PlanningProblem object successfully.

Ensure your solution to this is correct, as the following
parts build upon this function.

    This domain does not have 'cars' and 'trucks', etc. as in the
    original Rush Hour game. Instead, every vehicle is a 'Car' that
    occupies only one cell and may move one step along its orientation.
    The domain of cell names and adjacency relations is generated 
    programmatically.
        
    Start and goal states are passed in. The car doesn't 
    have an exit lane, rather we define a goal cell and consider
    the problem solved when it reaches it.

"""
PART 1.4 — EXTRA CREDIT
Generalized Rush Hour (4x4, with Trucks)
-------------------------------------------------

In this final part, you will implement a *generalized* Rush Hour domain 
for a 4x4 grid with trucks, which occupy two consecutive cells instead 
of just one.

The trucks may be:
 - Horizontal trucks: length 2 along a row
 - Vertical trucks:   length 2 along a column

You must define:
 -  A new function `rush_hour_with_trucks(config)` that creates 
    a `PlanningProblem` for this domain.

Once defined, the function should:
 - Create a `PlanningProblem` instance from a provided configuration.

Executing `GraphPlan` to compute a partial-order plan and
linearizing that plan on this planning problem should solve
in a reasonable amount of time on the autograder. 

Note:
    This part is HARD (a valid solution may not exist within compute 
    constraints imposed by the autograder). The GraphPlan algorithm (and its 
    linearization step) suffers greatly from the curse of dimensionality
    — as the grid and # vehicles/sizes grow, the search space 
    expands combinatorially. Even small configurations may 
    require nontrivial computation to solve. It will be graded as
    full points or none.

### Configuration Format

You will receive a configuration dictionary such as:

```
config = {
    'cars': {
        'R': {'pos': (3, 1), 'dir': 'Horizontal'},   # Red car, horizontal
        'A': {'pos': (1, 1), 'dir': 'Horizontal'},   # Car A, horizontal
        'B': {'pos': (4, 3), 'dir': 'Vertical'}      # Car B, vertical
    },
    'trucks': {
        'T1': {'pos': ((3, 2), (4, 2)), 'dir': 'Vertical'},  # Horizontal truck
        'T2': {'pos': ((2, 3), (3, 3)), 'dir': 'Vertical'}     # Vertical truck
    },
    'goal': {
        'R': (3, 4),                                 # Red car must reach exit
        'T1': ((1, 2), (2, 2))                       # Truck T2 must move up two cells
    }
}
```

Which represents an inital state of:

      C1  C2  C3  C4
   +------------------+
R1 |  A   *   .   .  |
R2 |  .   *   T2  .  |
R3 |  R   T1  T2  *  |      * represents goals for R, T1
R4 |  .   T1  B   .  |
   +------------------+


Note - positions are 1-indexed in the configuration
Note - the direction of trucks is included, but they will always
  only move in the direction of their longest axis.
Note - You can assume there will always be 3 cars - A,B,R, and two
  trucks - T1, T2.

Feel free to add, modify, or remove your own predicates, actions, etc.
